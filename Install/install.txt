  \section Prerequisites Prerequisites
The only requirements to run and contribute to RLPy are
a working Python 2.7 environment and the required package dependencies,
which can be installed automatically by the provided scripts.\n
Detailed installation instructions are shown below.\n
Installation FAQ available at bottom, general FAQ available on the FAQ page
or in the file FAQ.txt located in the RLPy folder.\n
\n
Recommended Operating Systems:\n
a) <B>Windows 32-bit</B>\n
b) <B>Ubuntu Linux 32/64-bit</B>\n
c) <B>Mac OSX</B> \n
\n
If your setup does not match those recommended above, you must download the packages manually, described in manual_install.txt.\n
\n
\n
    \section installation INSTALLATION: As easy as 1,2,3 (+4 to run)
===============================================================\n
===============================================================\n
1. Python 2.7\n
\n
Check to see if python is already installed by opening a terminal in any
OS and typing:\n
> python --version\n
\n
If you do not see the output "Python 2.7.3", download and install python,
for example, from ( http://www.python.org/getit/ )\n
\n
===============================================================\n
===============================================================\n
2. An IDE capable of development in Python\n
\n
Install a development environment of choice with Python support.\n
We recommend Eclipse Classic.  Note that eclipse requires the Java SDK.\n
To obtain Eclipse, download and follow the instructions:\n
i) Download+Install Eclipse Classic ( http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ )\n
ii) Install Pydev for Eclipse ( http://pydev.org/manual_101_install.html )\n
\n
See FAQ if eclipse fails to run.\n
\n
===============================================================\n
===============================================================\n
2.5. pip\n
a) Windows 32/64-bit\n
Install per instructions here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows\n
\n
b) Ubuntu Linux - automated in script\n
c) Mac OSX - automated in script\n
\n
===============================================================\n
===============================================================\n
3. Run the dependency installer script\n
\n
FIRST ensure the RLPy directory is located in the workspace folder of your
IDE, or whatever final location you intend it to be.\n
NEXT Extract the relevant installer zip file (RLPy-*.zip, where '*'
is Windows, Ubuntu, or MacOS) into the 'Installation' folder in the RLPy directory.\n
\n
THEN:\n
\n
a) <B>Windows 32-bit</B>\n
a.i) Open a command prompt window with administrative privileges:\n
     Windows 8:          WindowsKey-X, select "Command Prompt Admin"\n
     Windows 7,Vista: type 'cmd' in the start menu, right click and open 
with admin privileges\n
     Windows XP:      Start-->Run cmd.exe\n
a.ii) Navigate to the Install directory and run the .bat script.\n
\n
\n
\n
b) <B>Ubuntu</B> - Open a terminal window, navigate to the Installation 
folder,
and enter 'chmod u+x ubuntu_setup.sh'\n
Then run the provided script with ./ubuntu_setup.sh\n
\n
\n
\n
c) <B> Mac OSX </B> \n
c.i) The Command Line Tools (CLT) and/or XCode are required to use the 
script.
If you are unsure of your setup, type " xcode-select --version " at a 
terminal.\n
If you don't see a valid version number appear, follow the instructions 
here to
setup your environment: ( 
http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/ 
)\n
\n
c.ii) Open a terminal window, navigate to the Installation folder,
and enter 'chmod u+x OSX_setup.sh'\n
Then run the provided script with ./OSX_setup.sh\n
\n
---------------------------------------------------------------\n
** Note that the script requests administrative privileges to perform package installs.  If you are not comfortable with these privileges, you may install the following packages yourself:\n
numpy, scipy, matplotlib, networkx, graphviz, cython, scikit-learn\n
\n
Using ubuntu, this can be accomplished with the commands:\n
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-networkx graphviz python-pip libatlas-dev gfortran\n
sudo pip install cython\n
sudo pip install -U scikit-learn\n
\n
===============================================================\n
===============================================================\n
Installation of RLPy is now complete!\n
\n
4. Now open the framework in your IDE of choice.\n
\n
If using Eclipse:\n
i) Go to file -> switch workspace -> other\n
And navigate to the folder containing RLPy (NOT the RLPy folder itself.)\n
\n
ii) Go to file -> import -> general -> existing projects into workspace
And select 'Browse.'  Navigate into the RLPy directory and select 'Next.'\n
You should now see the RLPy directory structure in the left pane.\n
\n
===============================================================\n
===============================================================\n
\n
That's it!\n
\n
Now take a look at the \ref First_Run Getting Started Tutorial page,
and (as part of the tutorial) test the installation by running IshouldRun.py.\n
Finally, start experimenting with RLPy yourself!\n
\n
If you encountered errors in the installation, see the FAQ section at bottom\n
(and an extended FAQ located in the FAQ.txt file).\n

\section install_faq Insallation FAQ: Error/Solutions
U = Ubuntu, W = Windows, X = OSX\n
===============================================================\n
If you are having trouble installing on OSX, see the following:\n
http://www.thisisthegreenroom.com/2011/installing-python-numpy-scipy-matplotlib-and-ipython-on-lion/#numpy\n
\n
===============================================================\n
E: Generic messages on Mac OSX with "Canopy":\n
X: https://support.enthought.com/entries/23707811-TKinter-was-broken-on-Canopy-OS-X-1-0-1-fixed-in-1-0-3\n
\n
===============================================================\n
E: Eclipse Errors regarding missing packages e.g. 'Failed to import package numpy'
U,W,X: This likely indicates that eclipse is pointing to a previous version of python.\n
Go into Eclipse -> Preferences -> Pydev -> "Interpreter-Python", and at the very top, remove the existing entry and replace it with the version of python installed by RLPy, which is likely the directory you get when you type 'which python' at a terminal.\n
If prompted, allow Pydev to "Autoconfig."
\n
===============================================================\n
E: Generic messages about missing functions or 'module does not contain function xxx'\n
S: Ensure you have the latest version of scipy (0.11 as of this writing):\n
import scipy\n
scipy.version.version\n
S-U: if you don't have the correct version, run the following commands\n
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran python-pip\n
sudo pip install scipy --upgrade\n
===============================================================\n
E: Generic error messages regarding pylab, matplotlib, or TkAgg\n
S: The default matplotlib backend is set to TkAgg; this can be modified in GeneralTools.py.  If you do not have TKinter installed, remove the offending line and allow matplotlib to choose its own backend; this may cause artifacts in domain visualizations.\n
===============================================================\n
E: ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import\n
S1: Dont import pylab directly. Use Matplotlib.pylab\n
S2: sudo easy_install -U numpy\n
===============================================================\n
E: In eclipse sty is out of synch with the file system\n
S: Refresh (F5)\n
===============================================================\n
E: In Windows: Python does not appear to be installed (Eclipse
fails to locate python, or running 'python' in a command prompt gives
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable
program or batch file."\n
S-W: Set the path variables for python as described in: ( http://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows.html )\n
===============================================================\n

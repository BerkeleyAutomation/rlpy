\b Don't forget to mention that only the big files (agent, domain, etc) have been documented and that sub-classes are listed but not documented. Include any links in this format Domain (Link). \n
Also, there are some artifacts in mainfuntion.txt, lines like [ Frame this somehow as code / output / make it stand out?]]. You probably want to go over them in case they are still relevent, otherwise i will delete them

How to use Doxygen and generate the website:
1. Open the Doxygen wizard
2. Click File, Open, and open the file called Doxyfile in the Doxygen directory
3. Click the Run Tab
4. Click the Run Doxygen button
5. When the Doxygen is finished, run colorFix.py
6. Finished website is saved in html folder



NOTES:
1. Changing the location of the Doxyfile will change a lot of the compilation settings (they use relative directories), I recomend NOT moving it.
2. Doxygen updates and creates NEW files, but doesn't delete used ones. I recomend periodically deleting the entire html 
   folder and rebuilding the entire website from scratch every once in a while to remove unneccesary files (which there may be a lot of)
3. Sometimes you may have to reselect the project logo, to do this simply open the wizard, click the wizard tab, click the select button, open files, open ACL_logo.png

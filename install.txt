Python 2.7Check to see if python is already installed by opening a terminal in anyOS and typing:> python --versionIf you do not see the output "Python 2.7.3", download and install python,for example, from ( http://www.python.org/getit/ )==============================================================================================================================2. An IDE capable of development in PythonInstall a development environment of choice with Python support.We recommend Eclipse Classic.  Note that eclipse requires the Java SDK.To obtain Eclipse, download and follow the instructions:i) Download+Install Eclipse Classic ( http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ )ii) Install Pydev for Eclipse ( http://pydev.org/manual_101_install.html )See FAQ if eclipse fails to run.==============================================================================================================================2.5. pipa) Windows 32/64-bitInstall per instructions here:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windowsb) Ubuntu Linux - automated in scriptc) Mac OSX - automated in script==============================================================================================================================3. Run the dependency installer scriptFIRST ensure the RL-Python directory is located in the workspace folder of yourIDE, or whatever final location you intend it to be.THEN:a) Windows 32-bita.i)  Extract Win32_files.zip to a temporary directory of choice(recommend extracting to a folder within RL-Python directory to speed installation)a.ii) Open a command prompt window with administrative privileges:	Windows 8: 		 WindowsKey-X, select "Command Prompt Admin"	Windows 7,Vista: type 'cmd' in the start menu, right click and open with admin privileges	Windows XP:      Start-->Run cmd.exea.iii) Navigate to the temporary directory and run the .bat script.b) Ubuntu - Open a terminal window, navigate to the Installation folder,and run the provided script with ./ubuntu_setup.sh*** If the script fails to run, first type:chmod u+x ubuntu_setup.sh*** and re-run it.c) Mac OSX - Open a terminal window, navigate to the Installation folder,and run the provided script with ./OSX_setup.sh*** If the script fails to run, first type:chmod u+x OSX_setup.sh*** and re-run it.==============================================================================================================================Installation of RL-Python is now complete!4. Now open the framework in your IDE of choice.If using Eclipse:i) Go to file -> switch workspace -> otherAnd navigate to the folder containing RL-Python (NOT the RL-Python folder itself.)ii) Go to file -> import -> general -> existing projects into workspaceAnd select 'Browse.'  Navigate into the RL-Python directory and select 'Next.'You should now see the RL-Python directory structure in the left pane.==============================================================================================================================That's it!Now take a look at the \ref First_Run Getting Started Tutorial page,and (as part of the tutorial) test the installation by running IshouldRun.py.Finally, start experimenting with RL-Python yourself!If you encountered errors in the installation, see the FAQ section at bottom(and an extended FAQ located in the FAQ.txt file).Insallation FAQ: Error/SolutionsU = Ubuntu, W = Windows, X = OSX===============================================================If you are having trouble installing on OSX, see the following:http://www.thisisthegreenroom.com/2011/installing-python-numpy-scipy-matplotlib-and-ipython-on-lion/#numpy===============================================================E: Generic messages about missing environmental variablesS1: Ensure that the environment variable 'RL_PYTHON_ROOT' is set on your OS forwhatever environment you are running RL-Python in (e.g. it might be set in a terminalwindow but not in general).This should have been configured by the installer script; if your RL-Pythondirectory has moved since then, merely re-run the installer script andrestart your computer.S2: If the installer script fails to solve the problem, the easiest solution isto add the RL_PYTHON_ROOT variable to your IDE directly.In eclipse, go to window->preferences->pydev->interpreter Pydev->environment.There, add a variable called RL_PYTHON_ROOT and set its value to be the path toyour RL-Python directory.===============================================================E: Generic messages about missing functions or 'module does not contain function xxx'S: Ensure you have the latest version of scipy (0.11 as of this writing):import scipyscipy.version.versionS-U: if you don't have the correct version, run the following commandssudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran python-pipsudo pip install scipy --upgrade===============================================================E: ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to importS1: Dont import pylab directly. Use Matplotlib.pylabS2: sudo easy_install -U numpy===============================================================E: In eclipse sty is out of synch with the file systemS: Refresh (F5)===============================================================E: In Windows: Python does not appear to be installed (Eclipsefails to locate python, or running 'python' in a command prompt gives'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operableprogram or batch file."S-W: Set the path variables for python as described in: ( http://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows.html )===============================================================Please direct additional questions or bug reports torlpy[at]mit[dot]eduThanks to taag for the ASCII art (http://patorjk.com/software/taag/)

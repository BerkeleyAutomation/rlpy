(Elliot) Connect RL-Framework with ROS through the RCCar domain.
(Elliot) Improve iFDD Speed
- Optimization
- Feature Names
- bestAction in matrix form (how about breaking ties randomly)
- RL-Python directory is the key for running the code.
- Blending parameters between planning and learning. Make both of them uniform. Currently the output directory of the planner is hardcoded.

Progress:
================
- Inverted Pendulum
	(DONE) - Implement (Bobby)
	- Visualize (Bobby)
	- Run Sarsa with Tabular and iFDD and check results (Kemal)
- SysAdmin 
	(DONE) - 20 machines txt file. (Kemal)
	- Check the code with Sarsa with Tabular and iFDD make sure results are good (Kemal)
- PST
	(DONE) - Visualize (Bobby)
	- Make sure it makes sense (Bobby)
	- Check Sarsa with Tabular and iFDD (Kemal)
- Implement 
	- OMP-TD (Kemal)
	- BEBF (Kemal)



Bobby's Notes:

State transitions appear reasonable / sound
Note: UAV Crashes when fuel reaches 0 after an action (ie, with FULL_FUEL = 10, if the uav hasn't visited the base after the 10th action, it crashes. UAV cannot exist with 0 fuel outside of base)

Multiple chained communication states between base and goal are possible by setting NUM_COMMS_LOC

Direct Cost of fuel burn not mentioned in the tutorial, but included in paper; incorporate in model, currently FUEL_BURNED_REWARD_COEFF = 0.0

Visualization forthcoming


Kemal's notes:

IntruderMonitoring domain seems to be ok now, but I will check it with larger scale implementations and add visualization

Soundness needs verification

Visualization will be changed; graph needs to be directed; presently nodes compete for 'good' or 'bad' edges, since the edge color is set by each node's output [i.e. if a good node and bad node are connected, the good node will attempt to set its outgoing edge green, and the bad node will attempt to set the same edge red]

Tasks:
- Bring PacMan world into domains See info below
- Make representation usable with policy and other stuff. Take the value function dependency out

- Bring Pinball: https://github.com/pierrelux/pypinball
- Update doc to allow users to run these commands themselves if desired.
- Update doc to specifically describe ``contract'' between each funcional component.
    e.g. not allowed to modify state 's', what is datatype of 's', and 'a', etc.

- Merger should have data structure to store both type of the experiment and data. 
(Bobby) - Formatting change of license? Long lines with gaps between. <--- why don't we follow format of
- TBPI has problem with graphics due to deepcopy use.
- Blending parameters between planning and learning. Make both of them uniform. Currently the output directory of the planner is hardcoded.
- Eligibility Traces has to be set to zero when we finish an episode due to the episode cap
- Put a note that timing is CPU time for unix based but clock time for windows!
- Continuous Actions for domains
- Everything in dot format rather than * or outer. All items has to be ndarray rather than array.
- Improve iFDD Speed
- Optimization
- Feature Names
- bestAction in matrix form (how about breaking ties randomly)
(Elliot) - Fix the issue with legend not being shown during the run

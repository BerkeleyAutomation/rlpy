Tasks:
- Bring PacMan world into domains See info below
- Make the assumption that actions are discrete very visible (both code and website)
- Eliminate BatchExperiment and fuse the onlineExperiment with experiment
- Make representation usable with policy and other stuff. Take the value function dependency out

- Update doc to describe exactly what script is doing (some people correctly
don't like giving root access to a random script)
- Update doc to allow users to run these commands themselves if desired.
- Update doc to specifically describe ``contract'' between each funcional component.
    e.g. not allowed to modify state 's', what is datatype of 's', and 'a', etc.

- Eligibility Traces has to be set to zero when we finish an episode due to the episode cap
- Put a note that timing is CPU time for unix based but clock time for windows!
- Continuous Actions for domains
- Blending parameters between planning and learning. Make both of them uniform. Currently the output directory of the planner is hardcoded.
- Everything in dot format rather than * or outer. All items has to be ndarray rather than array.
- Config File For Experiments
- Improve iFDD Speed
- Optimization
- Feature Names
- bestAction in matrix form (how about breaking ties randomly)
(Elliot) - Fix the issue with legend not being shown during the run
- TBPI has problem with graphics due to deepcopy use.
- Make Config.py (perhaps use global variable)


Misc:
- Change "Bob Klein" to "Robert H Klein"

- Formatting change of license? Long lines with gaps between. <--- why don't we follow format of

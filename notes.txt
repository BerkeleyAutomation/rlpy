BEFORE PUBLIC RELEASE:
- Determine hosting / version control
- Choose logo, maybe feature cartpole or blocks as part of image

Tasks:
- Make Config.py (perhaps use global variable)
- Make the assumption that actions are discrete very visible (both code and website)
- Eliminate BatchExperiment and fues the onlineExperiment with experiment
- Make representation usable with policy and other stuff. Take the value function dependency out
- Improve iFDD Speed
- Optimization
- Feature Names
- bestAction in matrix form (how about breaking ties randomly)
- Blending parameters between planning and learning. Make both of them uniform. Currently the output directory of the planner is hardcoded.
- Everything in dot format rather than * or outer. All items has to be ndarray rather than array.
- Config File For Experiments
(Elliot) - Fix the issue with legend not being shown during the run
- TBPI has problem with graphics due to deepcopy use.
- Bring Pacman world into domains See info below
Misc:
- Formatting change of license? Long lines with gaps between.
- Change "Bob Klein" to "Robert H Klein"
- 


PacMan
================
Bobby:
I just looked it over quickly, but it obviously still has to perform all the same functions are our domains-
generateSuccessor() --> step
getLegalActions()
etc.

I think it would be really cool to add, and would definitely be a domain to advertise on the website to garner interest.  Pacman > GridWorld.
This would have to go on the backburner for me, next to the almost-forgotten RL-Glue helicopter domain and logo creation.

I'd be happy to implement it, but if you'd like it any sooner than a couple weeks from now, it might not be a bad idea to mention this to Elliot.
